# How to Help

I can use just about any form of help, regardless of your ability.

## Foreword

First of all, be sure to also support [Cactbot](https://github.com/quisquous/cactbot/) and [xivapi](https://xivapi.com/) since some data
is pulled from those projects.

## No Programming Ability Whatsoever

- The single most impactful thing you can do is spread the word. Especially on the web, since SEO is one of the biggest
  hurdles here. A simple link to this website along with a short blurb about what you like about it is incredibly helpful.
  Even if you're responding to an old reddit post where someone is asking about tools, that helps a lot.
- Report bugs and suggest features. 
- Write documentation or make guides. 

## I Know Some Programming

- Write triggers
- Maker more Job Overlays
- Improve automated test coverage

## I Know a Lot of Programming

- There is a [projects board](https://github.com/xpdota/event-trigger/projects/1) where I collect things I'd like to do - feel free to grab one of them and do it
- Take care of [my open issues on OverlayPlugin](https://github.com/ngld/OverlayPlugin/issues/created_by/xpdota)

## I Know how to Make Dalamud Plugins

I would like to make a companion Dalamud plugin, but I haven't really touched that realm myself. Main goals:
- Display overlays in-game a la Browsingway and similar plugins
- Have party list changes *pushed* to Triggevent rather than *polled* as with Telesto
- Get certain states that OverlayPlugin doesn't currently cache and/or ACT doesn't do well, like Map changes

## I Have Money

Seeing as my main computer is using a CPU from 2013, I could probably use a bit.

- I made a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/wynnxiv). But again, please also consider supporting Cactbot and XIVAPI.
