# Abyssos Triggers

Current status: Done through High Concept 1

## P5S

Most mechanics are complete. Unfortunately, it does not seem possible at this time to make triggers
for the jumping mechanic where the boss is untargetable.

## P6S

As with P5S, most mechanics are done, but the floor tiles mechanics rely on MapEffect lines which are
not widely supported yet.

## P7S

Most mechanics are done. 

A couple are still needed, namely:
- Exaflare direction
- A few tethers

## P8S Part 1

Done except for finding the direction of fourfold fires, which does in fact seem to be possible now.

## P8S Part 2

Incomplete, done through High Concept 1.
