# The Omega Protocol Ultimate (TOP)

Like every duty, triggers come from one of a few places:
1. Progging the fight myself
2. Triggers contributed by others
3. Log files (and sometimes videos) contributed by others
4. Looking at triggers added to other projects, such as Cactbot

#1 takes time. I have to prog the fight just like everyone else. I typically make use of
[Easy Triggers](/pages/tutorials/Easy-Triggers.md) during the raid, since it is very easy to
tab out, search for an event, and have a trigger made in a few clicks. Then, after the raid
night, I can turn them into fully blown triggers in the codebase, and release them to the public.

#2 and #3 are where you can help. If you happen to know Java, or at least want to learn, you can
submit a [pull request](https://github.com/xpdota/event-trigger/pulls) with new triggers. If you
made any Easy Triggers, you can also send them my way, and I can put them in the codebase. Lastly,
even if you don't make any triggers, log files are much appreciated, especially if there's also
a VoD to go along with it. You can post them on the 
[discussions](https://github.com/xpdota/event-trigger/discussions) area, or send them private
via discord (xp#0001).
