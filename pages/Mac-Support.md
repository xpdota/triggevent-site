description: Information about running Triggevent on a Mac

# Mac Support

Full disclaimer: I don't have a Mac. This is all secondhand information.

The general process would look something like this:

1. Install Java 17+
2. Download the Linux version of Triggevent
3. In a terminal, `cd` into the Triggevent directory, and run `triggevent.sh` as if you were running it on Linux

# Known Issues

Overlays are basically useless because I don't have click-through support on OS X, and without a Mac to test on,
it's very difficult to develop since it will probably involve native calls.
