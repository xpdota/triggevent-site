## Creating a Plugin

See [Custom Module](/pages/Custom-Module.md#out-of-tree) and [Example Module](https://github.com/xpdota/triggevent-example-module) for more information.

The example module project contains everything necessary to build and distribute a plugin (except Triggevent itself), including GitHub actions scripts
to build and publish it on github-pages.
